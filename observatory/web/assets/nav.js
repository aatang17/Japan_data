/* The site header, rendered from one description of the platform.

   Every page once carried its own hand-copied header, and they had already
   drifted apart — the cross-shareholding page listed four destinations, the
   CPI pages three, and neither offered the AI connector at all. The structure
   below is now the only place a section, a page, or a label is named.

   A page declares where it sits and includes this script directly after its
   header shell, so the bar is in the DOM before any page script looks for it:

     <header class="site-header" data-section="macro" data-page="explorer"></header>
     <script src="assets/nav.js"></script>

   Two tiers. The navy bar carries the markets — Japan, Hong Kong, United
   States — in full words, plus Docs and the reader's controls at the right: which country
   you are looking at is the first thing every page says. The light strip
   beneath it carries the current market's sections; a section with more than
   one page opens a menu of them. A small trail at the top of the content
   (Japan / Macro / Yield Curve) repeats the place in words. The landing page
   belongs to no section and sets data-section="" — it gets the last market
   visited, with no section marked current.

   A third tier exists only where one destination has more than one view of the
   same data (Inflation: the headline page and the item table). Those are the
   page entry's `tabs`, and they are deliberately NOT a third sticky bar — the
   strip is rendered inside the content column, into a placeholder the page
   puts at the top of <main>:

     <div class="page-tabs" data-page-tabs></div>

   The placeholder is filled on DOMContentLoaded, since <main> does not exist
   yet when this script runs. A page with no placeholder simply gets no tabs. */

/* ---------- section notes: two lines, then a toggle ----------

   Every section carries a paragraph explaining what its numbers are. They
   average four or five lines, and stacked above a chart they push the thing
   the reader came for below the fold. The first two lines carry the
   definition; the rest are caveats — read once, then in the way.

   So the note is folded to two lines with a "More" toggle beside it. The
   text is never removed: it stays in the DOM, so find-on-page, a crawler,
   and the prerendered answer pages all see the whole paragraph. A note that
   already fits gets no toggle, and the fit is measured again on resize,
   because a note that fits on a wide screen will not on a phone. */
