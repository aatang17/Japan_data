u"""M2 — ownership extractor: 大株主の状況 + 所有者別状況.

The other half of the ownership graph. `extract.py` reads what a company
HOLDS (policy shareholdings); this reads who holds IT — the register — out of
the same annual-report CSV package (EDINET type=5) that is already archived,
so nothing new is downloaded and no capture changes.

Three tables, in the equity namespace:

    eq_major_shareholders  one row per named holder in 大株主の状況
    eq_own_category        one row per investor category in 所有者別状況,
                           per share class
    eq_own_filings         one row per filing: register aggregates, the
                           denominators, and this dataset's own gates

Like board_extract.py it deliberately does NOT write eq_filings — that row is
the holdings extractor's vintage record, and two writers would fight over
`status`. eq_own_filings carries this dataset's own provenance (the SHA-256 of
the bytes it parsed, parser version, extraction status) and joins on doc_id.

WHAT THE NUMBERS MEAN, and the two things a reader must not be allowed to
assume:

  1. THE REGISTER IS NOT BENEFICIAL OWNERSHIP. Japan's top-ten is dominated by
     two nominee trust banks — 日本マスタートラスト信託銀行（信託口） and
     株式会社日本カストディ銀行（信託口） — which hold for index funds and
     pension money and own none of it. Ranked naively, the same two names are
     the largest shareholder of almost every listed company in Japan, which is
     true of the register and false of the market. Every row therefore carries
     a `holder_kind`, and anything derived from the register states whether
     nominee rows are in it. holder_kind is OUR classification, not a filed
     field: it is derived, and labelled as such wherever it is shown.
  2. THE RATIO'S DENOMINATOR EXCLUDES TREASURY SHARES. 大株主の状況 states
     発行済株式（自己株式を除く。）の総数に対する割合, while 所有者別状況
     percentages are of all issued shares. The two columns are close but not
     the same measure and must never be netted or compared row for row.

Percentages are stored as PERCENT. The XBRL carries them as pure fractions
(0.0918) while the filing prints 9.18 under a （％） header; ×100 is a unit
conversion of the filed figure, not a recomputation, and the printed precision
is preserved.

Gates (each recomputes a number the filer published, never one we invented):
    G1  category unit counts sum to the filer's own 計 row            (exact)
    G2  category percentages sum to 100                (rounding-aware)
    G3  named holders' ratios sum to the filer's own 計 ratio (rounding-aware)
    G4  a holder's shares do not exceed shares in issue
G2/G3 allow rows x half of the last printed digit, taken from the filing's own
precision — the only honest tolerance, since the filer rounds each row.

One writer at a time: stop the local `uvicorn app.main:app` first — DuckDB
counts its read-only connection as a conflicting lock — and never run this at
the same time as extract.py or board_extract.py.

Usage:
    python ownership_extract.py --limit 200                   # local smoke test
    python ownership_extract.py --all --source s3 --workers 16   # full 5 years
