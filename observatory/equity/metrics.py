u"""Run metrics and drift — noticing when a dataset quietly changes shape.

THE FAILURE THIS EXISTS FOR
---------------------------
Three things can go wrong with a feed, and until now we only caught the first.

  it stops    the job dies or the source is unreachable. Caught: the extractor
              records the failure, the last good data stays live, and the
              freshness clock stops advancing.
  it empties  the source renames a field. The parser still runs, still reports
              `clean`, and one column is now blank. Not caught by anything.
  it lies     the field is full and the values are wrong. Not caught either.

`canary.py` covers a handful of known filings exactly. This covers the whole
dataset approximately: after every run it writes down how many rows each table
holds, what share of each COLUMN came back non-null, and the mix of clean,
partial and failed. Compare that against recent runs and a field that stops
populating shows up the same night instead of the next quarter.

Two real cases from the week these extractors were written, both of which this
would have caught:

  * the board's opinion on a takeover was read on 4% of filings instead of 92%,
    because the element name moved between taxonomy years;
  * 285 allottee rows stored the literal word 名称 as the buyer's name, because
    a merged label cell repeats across the columns it spans.

WHY IT IS COMPUTED, NOT CONFIGURED
----------------------------------
The column list comes from the database schema, never from a hand-maintained
list of fields to watch. A list like that is correct on the day it is written
and wrong by the second dataset, and the field nobody remembered to add is
exactly the one that breaks.

WHY IT ONLY WARNS
-----------------
Drift never fails a run. A quiet week with no takeover bids is not a broken
parser, and a check that can block an ingest would cost a day of data the first
time it cried wolf and be switched off within the month. It flags, it is
reported, and a human decides.
