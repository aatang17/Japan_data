"""Business risks (事業等のリスク) — what each company says could hurt it.

The section of the annual securities report where management lists the risks
it believes could materially affect results, in its own words. Served as
filed: the text is the company's, verbatim, and nothing here summarises,
scores, classifies or translates it.

What IS derived, and says so:

  * **The items.** Filers number their risks — (1), ①, 1. — and the extractor
    cuts the section at those numbers (or, failing numbers, at short bracketed
    headings). The cut is ours; the words inside it are the filer's. A filing
    whose section could not be cut is served whole, status ``unsplit``.
  * **New / dropped.** An item is ``new`` when its heading, numbering removed,
    does not appear among the same company's headings in its previous annual
    report on file; ``dropped`` lists the previous report's headings missing
    from this one. A reworded heading shows as one new and one dropped — the
    comparison is of exact text, never of meaning. ``null`` where there is no
    earlier report to compare with.
