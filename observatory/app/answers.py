"""Answer pages: one permanent address per question people ask an assistant.

An AI answer engine reads a page as text and quotes the page whose first
lines state the answer plainly, dated and sourced. The data pages are built
for exploring; these are built for being quoted. Each is a static shell in
``web/`` (``japan-inflation-rate.html``) whose first paragraph, comparison
line, table and citation are written in by ``prerender`` at serve time from
the functions that serve ``/api/v1`` — so the quoted number is the number the
chart draws, and it changes when the ingest publishes a release, never by
hand. ``answer.js`` draws the chart and fills the same elements only when the
server left them empty.

A question is a registry entry here: which dataset and series, what kind of
figure it is (a rate of change, a stock level, a count, a yield, a growth
rate), and the nouns the sentence needs. Adding a question is an entry plus a
shell page; nothing else changes.

Every sentence follows the trust contract: an index level or a published
count is stated as published, a rate is calculated from published values and
the page says so under "Show calculation". Missing is a dash, never zero, and
a sentence that cannot be completed honestly is not written at all — the page
then serves without a lead and the script fills it, or it stays blank.
