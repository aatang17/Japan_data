"""Platform-calculated financial ratios — the screener's numbers.

Everything under /equity/financials/ is as filed. This module is the one
place a number is *computed*, and it follows the macro side's rule for
derived values: no badge, a formula instead, and every input named. A row
carries, for each metric, the formula, the inputs it used (value, element,
fiscal-year offset) and, where the filer prints the same ratio, the filer's
figure beside ours so the two can be reconciled.

Conventions — chosen to match how Japanese filers and sell-side analysts
compute these, and stated on the Methodology page:

  * Return ratios use the AVERAGE of opening and closing balances (the
    filer's own ROE convention under the Cabinet Office Ordinance). A row
    whose opening balance is not tagged gets no ratio rather than a
    closing-balance one, and a row whose average base is not positive gets
    none either — a return measured on negative equity inverts its own sign
    and would rank a loss-making, balance-sheet-insolvent company at the top.
    Such a row is flagged `negative_equity` instead, which is the finding.
    Filers disagree on the denominator (Chiyoda uses the average and matches
    this platform; Kodama Chemical uses the closing balance, and prints 82.8%
    where the average gives 144.9%) — hence one consistent convention here,
    with the filer's own figure and the difference on every row.
  * Equity is equity attributable to owners of the parent (自己資本): under
    IFRS the tagged element; under Japan GAAP net assets less
    non-controlling interests less subscription rights to shares. A balance
    sheet that prints no such line has none, so a missing subtrahend is nil
    — the only place this module treats an absent tag as zero, and only
    ever for a subtractive component below a total that is present.
  * Revenue and profit are the filer's own summary lines, resolved the same
    way as the key-indicator panel (banks and insurers report 経常収益;
    a filer with a custom revenue element is taken at its first summary
    line). Operating income is the summary's where printed, else the income
    statement's.
  * Free cash flow is operating cash flow less capital expenditure — the
    cash-flow statement's purchases of property, plant and equipment and of
    intangible assets. It was once operating plus *all* investing cash flow,
    which counts a treasury desk's securities buying as spending and a
    cross-shareholding sale as free cash: Sony read −¥25bn against ¥1.49tn
    on capex, Denso +¥494bn against ¥77bn, and one non-financial company in
    five was off by more than half. No capex line tagged, no free cash flow.
    Banks, insurers and brokers get none: their operating cash flow is the
    balance sheet moving, and "free" cash is not a meaningful figure there.
  * Valuation ratios exist only where the filer prints its year-end PER:
    implied price = PER × EPS, and everything with a price in it is
    labelled implied. This platform has no price feed.

Consolidated where the filing has consolidated statements, parent-only
otherwise; the row says which.
