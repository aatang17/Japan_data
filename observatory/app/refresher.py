"""The refresher: the one process that writes the data files, beside the site.

On Railway, start.sh is the website and the refresh in one container: it binds
the port, runs app/backfill.py behind it, and restarts the whole server once a
day. On the DigitalOcean server (docs/plans/PLAN-DROPLET-ZERO-DOWNTIME.md) the
website runs in a container that only serves, so a deploy can start the new
copy before it stops the old one, and this runs in a second container on the
same volume:

  * on a volume with nothing published, a cold build first, starting with
    the point-in-time seed (app.vintages seed). start.sh seeds at every boot,
    before the server opens the file; here the website always holds it open,
    so a write to it is refused, and only a fresh volume needs the seed;
  * once a day at REFRESH_AT (13:00 UTC by default): app/backfill.py with
    every dataset — the copy → ingest → swap the served files have always
    had — then the research desk backup and the data backup;
  * in between it sleeps, and says so in data/refresher-state.json. A deploy
    replaces it only while it is idle: a slice cut short loses only that
    slice, but an equity slice has run 97 minutes.

A start does not run a cycle at once when the last one finished within the
day (the ingest heartbeat says when). Otherwise every deploy that replaced
this container would repeat the hour-long copy pass that made the research
desk stall after each Railway deploy.

Nothing here changes Railway: start.sh does not use it.

Usage:  python -m app.refresher            # run forever
        python -m app.refresher once       # one cycle now, then exit
        python -m app.refresher status     # print the state file
