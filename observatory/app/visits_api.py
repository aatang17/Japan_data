"""The two things a page tells the server about itself.

Both exist because a request log cannot see reading. A reader who opens one
page and stays on it for ten minutes makes exactly one request, so without the
page saying "still here" and then "closed after 9 minutes 40", the honest
answer to how long anyone stayed is that we do not know.

Neither endpoint stores anything on the reader's machine, so neither needs
their permission. The third endpoint here does: it is where the banner's
answer is recorded, and the only place the visitor cookie is ever issued. See
app/visits.py for what each identity means.
