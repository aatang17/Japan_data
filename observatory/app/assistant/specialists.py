"""The catalogue of specialists: a brief, a tool allowlist, a schedule, a version.

A specialist is the unit the product sells and supports, so it is defined
here in code and versioned like software — not edited per desk. A desk
*hires* one (store.add_hire) and configures it; updating means a new version
here that the desk accepts.

Tool names are the generic MCP tools in tools_v2.py plus the desk and action
tools the runner provides. The allowlist is enforced by the runner, whatever
the prompt says: a specialist may only call what its manifest lists.
