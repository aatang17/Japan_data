"""Adapter: rice contract prices — MAFF 米の相対取引価格.

Source: 農林水産省, 「米の相対取引価格・数量」. Every month MAFF surveys the
shippers that handle 5,000 tonnes of rice a year or more and publishes the
volume-weighted average price actually contracted between them and wholesalers,
separately for each 産地品種銘柄 — origin-and-variety brand, about 120 of them.
The figure is yen per 60kg of brown rice, inclusive of freight, packaging and
consumption tax, for first-grade table rice.

This is the benchmark price of Japanese rice. It is what the 2025-26 rice
crisis was measured in, it is the number farm policy is argued about, and no
English-language product carries it at brand level.

**Shape of the source.** One workbook per crop year, each a grid of brands
down the side and the crop year's twelve months across the top — September
of the crop year through the following August, which is how the rice trade
counts a year. Crop years tile without overlap, so a calendar month belongs
to exactly one workbook; a gate below checks that stays true. Prices are
provisional (速報) and MAFF does not revise them once the crop year closes.

**Two file formats, one history.** The 2019 crop year onward is .xlsx; the
eleven crop years before it are legacy .xls, and the 2018 file is served 340
bytes short of a whole sector. Reading only the modern half would throw away
two thirds of the history, so `xls.py` exists and both readers return the same
shape. See its module docstring.

**A brand's identity survived a layout change.** Through the 2017 crop year
the table carried a third key column, 地域区分, so Uonuma Koshihikari was
(新潟, コシヒカリ, 魚沼); from 2019 the region moved inside the brand name as
コシヒカリ（魚沼）. Both are folded to the same series here, because they are
the same series — the alternative is every regional Koshihikari chart breaking
in half at 2018.

**Brand names are curated, and an unknown brand fails the ingest.** MAFF
publishes no code for a 産地品種銘柄; the Japanese name is the identity. Series
codes are built from a checked romanisation (`price.15.koshihikari.uonuma`), so
a brand that is not in `BRANDS` cannot be given a code without guessing. It
raises instead. That is deliberate: ingest is fail-safe, so the previous
release stays live and `/api/v1/catalog/health` reports an unpublished
artifact the same day — which is the signal to add the new variety, not a
reason to invent a code for it. New varieties appear once or twice a year.

**Missing is missing.** A dash means either that no contract was struck for
that brand that month or that the month's contracted volume was under 100
tonnes and MAFF suppresses the price. Neither is zero, and the two are not
distinguishable in the file, so both stay gaps.
