"""Adapter: Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta Wage Growth Tracker.

Source: the Atlanta Fed's wage-growth-data.xlsx (atlantafed.org, research
and data, Wage Growth Tracker). The tracker follows the same people in the
Census Bureau's Current Population Survey twelve months apart and reports
the median of their individual wage changes, 100 × ln(wage[t] / wage[t−12])
— wage growth for people who stayed employed, free of the shift in who is
working that moves an average-earnings figure.

Every value is already a rate in percent, published by the Atlanta Fed; a
percentage change of one is refused, and changes are in percentage points.

What is loaded, by sheet:

- `data_overall` — the headline and eleven cuts (full-time, job stayers
  and switchers, paid hourly, weighted medians, weekly basis, trimmed
  mean), **3-month moving averages**, from 1997.
- `data_chart1`–`data_chart3` — the unsmoothed median, the 25th and 75th
  percentiles, the mean, and the share of zero wage changes.
- `WGT_1983` — the headline back to 1983.
- The demographic and job sheets (age, sex, race, education, occupation,
  industry, census division, wage quartile, ...) — **12-month moving
  averages**, because the samples are small.

The `Alternative WGT` sheet (a methodological variant described on the Atlanta
Fed's blog) and the recession shading columns are not loaded. A column that
repeats the overall median on a demographic sheet is not loaded twice.

Series codes are built from the sheet and the column and are this platform's
own; the smoothing window is part of every series name.
