"""Adapter: Japan population by prefecture — Basic Resident Register.

Source: 総務省 (Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications), 住民基本台帳に
基づく人口、人口動態及び世帯数 — the count of everyone actually on a
municipality's resident register as of 1 January, published each July.
This is administrative-register data, not a survey: no sampling error, and
it is the only annual source that splits Japanese and foreign residents on
the same definition, at the same date, for every prefecture.

Six prefecture-level workbooks make one picture, and one ingest takes all
six as a single artifact: three resident segments (総計 all / 日本人住民
Japanese / 外国人住民 foreign) × two tables (population, households and
the year's register flows; population by five-year age band and sex).

Facts the parser and the gates rely on:

- **The ministry keeps only the current year online.** Last year's
  workbook is deleted — the same /main_content/ id is overwritten, and
  older ids 404. e-Stat is the only archive of prior years. That makes
  running this ingest every July the whole point: nobody else is
  accumulating the vintages.
- Content ids change without notice (000494956 in 2017, 000633315 in
  2019, 000892948 since 2023), so `fetch()` resolves the links off the
  ministry's page rather than pinning URLs.
- **Column layout differs by segment** — the Japanese-resident workbook
  splits households into all-Japanese and mixed-nationality; naturalisation
  is an *addition* there and a *deletion* in the foreign workbook. Columns
  are therefore resolved by their two header rows, never by position, and
  an unrecognised column fails the ingest rather than being dropped.
- **Stocks and flows are dated differently, because they are.** The
  workbook stamped 令和8年1月1日 carries the population on 1 Jan 2026 and
  the register flows for calendar 2025. Stocks take 1 Jan of the stock
  year; flows take 1 Jan of the year they cover, so that
  population(Y+1) − population(Y) equals the flows dated Y.
- 社会増減 ("social change") is net change *minus* natural change, which
  is not the same as in-migrants minus out-migrants: it also carries
  naturalisations and other register corrections. The identity
  in_total − out_total = social_change fails for all 48 areas, by design.
  Never label it "migration".
- A handful of records carry no usable birth date or sex, so the age bands
  fall a few dozen short of the published total (43 people nationally in
  the 2026 file, out of 123.8 million). The residual is real, is left in
  the published totals exactly as released, and is reported in the
  validation summary so a surface can disclose it rather than hide it.

Published rates (増減率 etc.) are deliberately *not* stored: rates are
calculated on the platform and carry their formula, per the trust
contract. They are used here as a cross-check — our recomputed rate must
match the ministry's to within a rounding tolerance, or the ingest fails.

Counts of people are levels, not indices: `weight_per_10000` is
meaningless and stays NULL, and flows go negative.
