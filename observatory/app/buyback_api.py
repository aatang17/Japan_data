"""Equity product API — buyback lifecycle (自己株券買付状況報告書).

Announcement → execution → cancellation, from one monthly filing (EDINET type
220). Same DuckDB file and the same reader as the two equity APIs next door;
registered before them so its literal /equity/buyback/ paths win.

Three things are worth knowing before reading any number here:

  1. **Announced and executed are different measures.** The authorisation is a
     ceiling a board voted for; the cumulative is what the company actually
     bought. A programme can close with most of the authorisation unspent, and
     that is the question this dataset exists to answer — never present the
     authorisation as if it were spending.
  2. **The filer publishes its own progress percentage** (自己株式取得の進捗状況),
     and that figure is official, as filed. The `completion_pct` this API
     computes is derived — cumulative ÷ authorised on the yen column — and is
     returned alongside, never instead. Where the filer published no percentage
     the row says so (`unverified`): the figures are extracted but nothing
     reconciled them.
  3. **A closed window is not a cancelled programme.** `expired_unspent` means
     the acquisition period ended with the authorisation unspent. A formal
     abandonment is announced on TDnet, which this dataset does not carry.

Retirement (消却) is a separate act from buying: a company can buy shares and
hold them in treasury for years. Shares retired are shares permanently gone,
so retirements are reported on their own, never netted against purchases.

Coverage is capped by EDINET, not by us: type 220 filings are purged after
roughly a year, so nothing before 2025-08-12 is retrievable by anyone.
