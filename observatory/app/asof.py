"""Point-in-time reads of the filing datasets: what EDINET held on a date.

The macro side has served `?as_of=` since the vintage store landed — ask for a
CPI series as of last July and you get the numbers a reader would have had
then, from the append-only vintage history. The filing datasets could not
answer the same question, and this is what lets them.

**The basis is the filed date, and that is a decision, not a shortcut.** The
plan specified "what the platform had captured on that date", falling back to
the filed date. No capture timestamp exists: `eq_filings`, `eq_own_filings`,
`eq_lvh_filings`, `eq_fac_filings`, `eq_fin_filings`, `eq_seg_filings` and
`eq_agm_meetings` record when a document was FILED, and `eq_buyback_filings`
when it was SUBMITTED, and nothing anywhere records when we fetched it. So
capture-time semantics are not reconstructible for a single filing already in
the archive, and pretending otherwise would be a fiction dressed as a vintage.
`as_of` here means: **the filings that existed publicly on EDINET by the end of
that day.** Every response says so.

That is the weaker of the two claims and the honest one. It is also the more
useful one for a backtest — what the market could read — while "what we had
captured" only ever describes this platform's own plumbing.

How the ceiling travels
-----------------------
A ceiling applies to a whole request, not to one query: a company view that
answered half its blocks as of a past date and half as of today would be worse
than refusing. It is therefore set once at the request boundary — see
`scope()` — and read by every filing-selection query through `clause()`.

The obvious risk of that design is a query that forgets to ask. Nothing about
a contextvar makes a stale query fail loudly; it just quietly returns today's
filing. So the guarantee is not that every query was found by reading the code
— it is `tests/test_asof.py`, which runs every company view under a ceiling
and fails if ANY date anywhere in the response is later than it. A query that
forgets the clause fails that test, which is the only form of assurance worth
having here.
