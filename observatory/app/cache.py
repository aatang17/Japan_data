"""Release-versioned HTTP cache for the read API.

Every GET under /api/v1 is a pure function of the published release: the data
only changes when ingest rewrites the DuckDB file, and in production that
happens at boot, before uvicorn starts. So a response stays valid until the
file changes — which is what both halves of this middleware exploit.

Server side: the cache stores the *serialized* body, not the query result.
The expensive part of a large response is JSON encoding and compression, not
the DuckDB scan, so caching after the encoder is what actually saves time; a
repeat hit costs one dict lookup and no compression work.

Client side: the same entry carries an ETag and Cache-Control, so a browser
that has the payload already revalidates with an empty 304 instead of pulling
the megabyte down again.

Entries are keyed by (path, query string) and stamped with the database
version. A new ingest changes the stamp, which invalidates every entry at
once — nothing here can serve data from a superseded release.
