# Ownership percentage. There is no price feed in this product and there does

# capitalisation IS its share of shares outstanding. The denominator therefore
# comes from the issuer's OWN annual report — issued shares at its fiscal year
# end, less treasury — which we already hold, because most issuers of policy
# holdings are themselves filers.
#
# Two dates never line up. The holder reports its stake at its own fiscal year
# end; the issuer reports its share count at the issuer's. We take the issuer
# filing NEAREST that date, either side, because nearest-in-time is the best
# estimate of the share base the stake was measured against — an issuer report
# three months later describes it better than one nine months earlier. Ties go
# to the earlier filing, and the date used is always returned.
#
# The failure this guards against is a stock split inside that window. The
# holder's share count is post-split and the issuer's pre-split, so the stake
# reads high by the split ratio — Hulic's stake in Fuyo General Lease read

# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Claim check
#
# The gap this closes: a figure quoted in the press and a figure from this
# product can differ by 4.5x and both be right. Nikkei Asia put the three
# megabanks' cross-shareholdings at ¥2.56tn at 30 September 2025; we hold
# ¥11.5085tn at 31 March 2026. Acquisition cost vs carrying amount, interim vs
# annual. Without somewhere to put that, one of those numbers gets quoted as a
# correction of the other.
#
# The design rule that makes this trustworthy: THIS CODE NEVER INFERS THE
# CLAIM'S BASIS. The caller states it, in typed fields, or does not state it —
# and where it is not stated we say the gap cannot be classified rather than
# picking the explanation that fits. `context` is echoed back and never parsed.
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Deliberately not a truth vocabulary. The strongest verdict available is
# "not consistent with any basis we hold": this reports what we can and cannot
# corroborate from filings, and never grades a publisher.
