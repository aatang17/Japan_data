"""Country and network operator for an address, from the DB-IP Lite tables.

Used by app/visits.py to answer "where are readers, and what kind of network
are they on" — the second being the more useful of the two for this product:
a read from a bank's corporate network means something a country code does
not.

The address is still never stored. A country code and a network name are
derived while the request is in flight and the address is discarded with the
rest of the scope, exactly as before.

Loading is deliberately timid. The tables are fetched once a month into
data/geo/, parsed on a background thread after the port is already open, and
published only when complete — so a request that arrives early, or on a boot
with no route to DB-IP, is recorded with no country rather than delayed or
failed. Nothing here can raise into a response.

Ranges are held as `array` integers rather than Python objects: the same data
as lists of ints and tuples costs about 180 MB, which is not a reasonable
thing to hold in a serving process for an analytics nicety. As arrays it is
about 25 MB.

IPv6 ranges are indexed on their top 64 bits. Allocations are /32 to /64 in
practice, so this resolves every realistic case; a range narrower than a /64
attributes its whole /64, which is immaterial at the resolution this feeds.

Data: DB-IP Lite, CC BY 4.0. Attribution is shown wherever the results are
(the Traffic page and its exports) — see https://db-ip.com.
