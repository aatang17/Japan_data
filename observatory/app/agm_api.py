u"""Equity product API — AGM voting results (臨時報告書, 株主総会決議).

What shareholders actually did, proposal by proposal and — for board elections
— director by director. Served from the same DuckDB file and reader as the
rest of the equity product.

WHAT A CONSUMER MUST NOT ASSUME, carried in the data rather than in prose:

  1. THE PERCENTAGE IS THE COMPANY'S, NOT OURS, AND CANNOT BE REBUILT FROM THE
     COUNTS. Almost every filer states that it stopped tallying attending
     votes once the outcome was settled (出席した株主の議決権の数の一部を加算
     しなかった理由), so the denominator behind 賛成割合 is never published.
     `approval_pct` is exactly as filed and carries the official badge.
     `approval_pct_of_counted` is OUR arithmetic over the disclosed counts and
     carries its formula instead; the two differ by a median of 0.14pp and
     occasionally much more. Never present the derived one as the company's.
  2. A BOARD ELECTION HAS NO PROPOSAL-LEVEL VOTE. The filing publishes one
     result per candidate and no total, so proposal-level counts are null for
     those and `candidates` says how many rows sit underneath. Summing the
     candidates would invent a figure nobody filed.
  3. VOTING RIGHTS ARE NOT SHARES. Counts are in 個 — voting-right units, one
     per trading unit — so they do not equal share counts and must not be
     compared with the shares in the 5% filings or the register.
  4. ABSENCE IS NOT DISSENT. A shareholder who did not vote appears nowhere.
     A low approval percentage means votes actively cast against, which is why
     it is a much sharper signal in Japan than a low turnout would be.
  5. A DISMISSAL VOTE READS BACKWARDS, AND IS NEVER RANKED WITH ELECTIONS.
     取締役の解任の件 asks shareholders to REMOVE a named director, so 0.5%
     approval means the attempt was crushed and the director kept the seat —
     the opposite of what the same number means under an election. Ranking the
     two together put retained directors at the top of "lowest support", which
     is a wrong number, not a presentational quibble. /directors serves
     elections by default; `kind=dismissal` serves removal votes, where a HIGH
     percentage is the adverse signal.
  6. A RANKING SHOWS ONLY ROWS WE CAN CORROBORATE. Every row is stored as
     filed, but /directors and /proposals rank only those whose filed
     percentage our own arithmetic over the disclosed counts can reproduce
     within 15pp (`pct_consistent`). Without that a single misread cell — an
     against-rate column read as an approval rate — would put a fictitious
     0.1% at the top of "lowest support" and above every genuine result.
     `include_unverified=true` returns them anyway, flagged.
  7. THE ARCHIVE STARTS IN APRIL 2024. 臨時報告書 leave EDINET's public
     inspection window far sooner than annual reports do; nothing earlier
     survived to be captured, and no back-fill can recover it.
