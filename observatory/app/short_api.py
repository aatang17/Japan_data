u"""Equity product API — short positions (空売り残高, JPX daily disclosure).

The mirror of the 5% filings next door. A holder whose short position reaches
0.5% of an issuer's shares must report it, and the exchange publishes every
report the next business day: holder, address, issuer, ratio, share count, and
the day the position was measured.

WHAT A CONSUMER MUST NOT ASSUME, carried in the data rather than in prose:

  1. **A REPORT IS AN EVENT, NOT A POSITION.** Each row is one report on its
     own calculation date. A holder files again only when the position moves,
     so the outstanding book is the LATEST report per (issuer, holder, fund)
     — which is what /company and /companies return, with the formula beside
     it. It is derived and carries no badge.

  2. **THE BOOK IS ONLY AS COMPLETE AS THE TAPE IS LONG.** JPX keeps about
     twelve business days on its site and deletes the rest; our archive starts
     the day capture started. A position opened before that and not moved
     since has never been published into it. Every surface here states how
     many days the archive holds, because that number *is* the completeness of
     the book.

  3. **A CLOSING REPORT IS A REAL ZERO.** A holder falling under 0.5% files one
     last report saying so; it carries below_threshold and a ratio at or near
     zero. That is the position going away, not a missing value, and it is
     what takes the position out of the book.

  4. **THE SUM OVER HOLDERS IS NOT THE SHORT INTEREST.** Only positions of 0.5%
     or more are disclosed at all, so an issuer's total here is the *disclosed*
     short, always an understatement of the true one. It is never presented as
     short interest.

  5. **SHARES AND RATIO HAVE DIFFERENT DENOMINATORS FROM THE 5% FILINGS.** The
     ratio is JPX's own 空売り残高割合 against shares outstanding, not the
     statutory 株券等保有割合 the long filings use. The two are not comparable
     to the decimal and are never netted against each other.
