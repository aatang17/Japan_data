u"""Flags for a filed number the filing itself cannot support.

Every figure we publish is as filed, and that is the point of the product. But
a handful of filings state a number that is arithmetically impossible against
another number on the same document, or that no company has ever reported:
an average employee salary of 9.5 trillion yen, a board of 8,000 officers, a
5% holding larger than the shares in issue printed beside it.

Those numbers stay exactly as filed. What changes is that they no longer arrive
unlabelled. Each rule here recomputes something the filing publishes and, where
the two disagree, attaches a `flags` entry saying which figure and why.

Two places apply the same rules, deliberately:

  * the extractors (`board_extract` G6-G8, `lvh_extract` G7, `extract`'s
    portfolio gate), which mark the filing `partial` when it is parsed;
  * here, at serve time, because the extractors run incrementally and will not
    revisit a filing from 2022 that was parsed before those gates existed.

A row that was already flagged by its extractor gets the same flag from both,
which is harmless -- `flags` is a set of reasons, not a count.

Thresholds are not round numbers chosen for comfort. Each is set outside the
whole archive's observed range, and the constant carries the observation:

    officers          largest real board + auditors in 21,176 filings:     52
    salary            1st..99th percentile of average pay:  3.6m .. 13.8m yen
    pay per officer   largest package ever disclosed in Japan:        ~13.4bn
