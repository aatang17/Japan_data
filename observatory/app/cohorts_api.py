u"""Cohort comparison — a company read against its peer group, not the market.

Routes under ``/api/v1/equity/cohorts``:

    GET  /                      the cohorts that can be asked for, with counts
    GET  /metrics               the metrics a cohort can be compared on
    GET  /members?cohort=       who is in a cohort
    GET  /company/{sec_code}    the cohorts one company belongs to
    GET  /compare?cohort=&metric=   the distribution, ranked, with quartiles

What this adds over the existing screens is the denominator. `/compare` takes
the same numbers those screens already publish and ranks them **inside** a
cohort — a TOPIX scale band, a JPX industry, a market segment, the Nikkei 225
where the deployment is entitled to it, or a basket of codes the reader names
themselves — and returns the cohort's own distribution beside each row, so a
value can be read as a percentile rather than as a bare figure.

Trust contract: nothing here is a new measurement. Every metric is either a
figure as filed or one of the ratios `fin_metrics` already computes, and each
carries its formula on the response, exactly as it does on its own screen.
The cohort statistics (median, quartiles, percentile rank) are derived and
carry their formulas too. Companies with no value for a metric are counted and
disclosed, never imputed and never treated as zero.
