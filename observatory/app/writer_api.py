"""The Writer Desk's own API, under /admin/api/write (``web/write.html``).

The article endpoints the desk shares with the editor are in
app/research_api.py. This module holds what is about the writer and their
publications rather than one article:

``GET  /me``                                who is signed in, and where they write
``POST /signout``                           end this browser's writer sessions
``POST /publications``                      open a publication: one of your own, or (Plover team) for anyone
``PUT  /publications/{id}``                 its name, tagline and description (owner)
``GET  /publications/{id}/members``         who writes there (any member)
``POST /publications/{id}/members``         invite someone (owner); returns a sign-in link
``PUT  /publications/{id}/members``         change a role (owner)
``DELETE /publications/{id}/members``       remove someone (owner)
``POST /publications/{id}/members/link``    a fresh sign-in link for a member (owner)
``GET  /publications/{id}/assistant``       its Assistant Settings: skills, house style, connectors (any member)
``POST/PUT/DELETE .../assistant/skills``    its skills (editor)
``PUT  .../assistant/house-style``          its house style (editor)
``POST/PUT/DELETE .../assistant/connectors`` its connectors, their check and tools (owner)
``GET/POST/DELETE /keys``                   personal keys for the writer's own AI agent

It sits under /admin/api only so that the Plover team's staff session cookie
(scoped to /admin) reaches it; nothing here is part of the admin console.
