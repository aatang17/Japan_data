"""MCP endpoint — lets an external AI assistant use the published data.

A remote Model Context Protocol server in its "Streamable HTTP" shape,
deliberately stateless: one POST /mcp route speaking JSON-RPC 2.0, no
sessions, no server-initiated streams. That subset is all a read-only tools
server needs, and it is what lets a user connect by pasting one URL into
Claude (or any MCP client) with no install and no login.

The tools served are the shared layer in tools.py — the same wrappers over
the same functions that serve /api/v1, so a connected assistant can only ever
see numbers the public API already publishes, with the same trust labels,
formulas, and cite URLs. No tool here may bypass that layer.

Implemented directly rather than via the official MCP SDK because the SDK
requires Python 3.10+ and app/ code must run on the 3.9 used locally. The
protocol methods a stateless tools-only server must answer are few:
initialize, the initialized notification, ping, tools/list, and tools/call.
Plus resources/list and resources/read, which serve the dataset manifests
(app/registry.py) as `observatory://datasets/{id}`.

Two tool surfaces coexist behind MCP_TOOLSET (v1 | v2 | both, default both):
the original per-dataset tools in tools.py, and the six generic tools in
tools_v2.py whose `dataset` argument is resolved through the registry.

Kill switch: MCP_ENABLED — on by default (unlike ASK_ENABLED, nothing here
generates text or spends money; it serves the same bytes as the API), set it
to a falsy value to turn the endpoint off.

This server publishes Japanese consumer price statistics from the Japan Data \
Observatory: cpi-jp (~80 category aggregates: headline CPI, cores, major \
expenditure groups) and cpi-jp-items (~740 individually priced items), \
monthly from 1970.

Ground every figure you state in a tool result from this conversation — the \
data is revised and extended monthly, so never answer from memory. Missing \
values are missing, never zero. Index levels (2020 = 100) are official \
statistics exactly as the Statistics Bureau of Japan published them; \
year-over-year, month-over-month, and 3-month annualized rates are calculated \
by this platform from those indices and each response carries the formula \
used in its `calc` field — keep official and calculated figures distinct \
when quoting them. Every response includes a `cite` URL, a permanent page \
showing the same view; link it when you present the numbers. Source credit: \
Statistics Bureau of Japan, via the Japan Data Observatory.

It also publishes three other Japanese macro datasets, each in its own \
measure and never to be ranked or combined with the price indices or with \
each other. VISITOR ARRIVALS (jnto-visitors) — monthly counts of foreign \
visitors by market from 2003, published by the Japan National Tourism \
Organization and computed by it from Ministry of Justice immigration \
statistics; use get_arrivals_ranking to find market codes and to answer \
"which markets are up or down the most", and get_arrivals for history. The \
two most recent months are JNTO estimates: still official, but rounded to \
the nearest 100 and covering only the largest markets, so rankings and \
shares are served on the latest month with a complete breakdown and every \
response says which month that is. A region is the sum of its member \
markets — never add a parent to its children. Credit: Japan National \
Tourism Organization (JNTO). JGB YIELD CURVE (jgb-yields) — Ministry of \
Finance constant-maturity yields for 15 tenors, in percent per year, which \
can be genuinely negative; get_yield_curve. BANK OF JAPAN (boj-assets) — \
JGB holdings and monthly flows in yen, where a negative net flow is real \
balance-sheet runoff, not a missing value; get_boj_balance_sheet, whose \
response carries the Bank's required credit line."""

# Appended to INSTRUCTIONS when the cross-shareholding database is present.
EQUITY_INSTRUCTIONS = """

This server also publishes Japanese cross-shareholding (policy shareholding, \
政策保有株式) data extracted from companies' annual securities reports filed \
on EDINET: named holdings with share counts, yen book values, prior-year \
figures, and the stated purpose of each holding, plus the reverse view of \
who holds a company. Figures are exactly as filed, and every one of them is \
balance-sheet CARRYING AMOUNT at fiscal year end from an annual report. That \
basis is returned with each response and must be stated with any figure you \
quote. It is NOT the basis the press and IR decks usually use: reduction \
targets and progress figures are quoted on acquisition cost, often at \
commercial-bank level rather than group level, often listed shares only, and \
often at a half-year date this product does not hold. Those differences run \
to several times the figure, not a few percent. Before you set a number from \
here against a published one, call check_claim; never reconcile the two \
yourself by assuming a convention. The dataset accumulates \
filing by filing and does not yet cover the whole market — call \
get_holdings_summary first and state its coverage with any aggregate you \
quote. Yen book values are levels, a different measure from CPI indices; \
never rank or combine the two. Source credit: company filings on EDINET \
(Financial Services Agency), via the Japan Data Observatory.

From the same annual reports it publishes BOARDS AND PAY: every director with \
title, role, age and shareholding; officer remuneration by category; and the \
individuals whose consolidated remuneration is disclosed. Two rules an \
assistant must not break. First, named individual pay is 連結報酬等 — \
CONSOLIDATED, including pay from group companies — and is a different basis \
from the officer-category table, so the two are never netted, subtracted or \
divided into one another, and people appear who do not sit on the board. \
Second, the filed category total is the published number; its components \
often do not sum to it because filers disagree on whether non-monetary pay is \
additive or an 'of which' memo, so check components_reconcile before quoting a \
component. Call get_governance_summary first and state its coverage."""
