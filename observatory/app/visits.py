"""Server-side visit counting: traffic as the server itself sees it.

Script-tag analytics (Plausible, Google Analytics) are blocked by default on
the bank and fund networks this product is aimed at, so they undercount
exactly the readers that matter. Counting inside the app sees every request,
blocker or not, and needs no third party and no cookie banner.

A visitor is HMAC(daily salt, address + user agent), truncated: stable for one
UTC day so a session counts once, unlinkable across days, and not reversible
to an address. No address is ever stored. The salt lives beside the log on the
volume, so a restart does not split a day's visitors in two.

That identity deliberately dies at midnight, which makes "did this reader come
back next week" unanswerable. A reader who accepts the banner is given a
durable random id in a cookie instead, and their events are keyed on a hash of
it: the same person across days, still no address and still nothing that says
who they are. Consent is the whole difference between the two identities, so
the cookie is issued by one endpoint the reader's own click reaches, never set
by the counter as a side effect of serving a page. Declining is recorded the
same way — a stored "no" is what stops the banner asking again.

Two things need no consent and are measured for everyone: the count of readers
active in the last few minutes, which lives in memory and is never written
down, and how long a page was open, which the page reports at the moment it
closes. Neither stores anything on the reader's machine, and both are keyed on
whichever identity that reader already has.

Writes take the same shape as the admin audit trail (see admin_api.py):
append-only JSONL under data/, no DuckDB write path anywhere (CLAUDE.md,
Ingest Guardrails 5), and no failure able to reach a response. Events are
buffered and flushed in batches, so a kill loses at most the live buffer —
immaterial for a visit counter.

The counts are an estimate and the admin page says so: one office behind one
address on one browser version reads as a single visitor, while one person on
a laptop and a phone reads as two.
