"""Equity product API — facilities and land (主要な設備の状況).

One row per facility a company discloses in its annual report: site, city-level
location, per-asset-class book values, land area. The dataset behind the
facilities map, and the screen for the classic hidden-land question: who sits
on large landholdings carried at decades-old cost?

Three things to know before reading any number here:

  1. **Book value is not market value — that gap is the point.** Land is
     carried at historical cost under JGAAP; a 1960s purchase is still on the
     books at 1960s prices. This API returns the filed figures and, where the
     filing discloses land area, the derived yen-per-㎡ — it never estimates a
     market value.
  2. **Coordinates are derived, not filed.** Filers disclose city-level
     addresses (東京都渋谷区). Each is matched to its municipality and plotted
     at the municipality's centroid — good for a national map, meaningless for
     a parcel. Rows that name no unambiguous municipality carry no
     coordinates rather than a guessed pin. Centroids derive from Geolonia
     Japanese-addresses (CC BY 4.0); credit that source wherever they render.
  3. **"Major facilities" is the filer's cut, not a register.** The section
     lists what the filer deems major; totals here are a floor, not the
     balance sheet. The extraction is gated both ways — rows must recompute
     the filer's own 合計, and land must not exceed consolidated
     balance-sheet land (own + trust) — and cross-sectional surfaces use only
     filings that passed ('clean'); a company page states the status of
     whatever filing it shows.

Same DuckDB file and reader as the equity APIs next door; registered before
them so the literal /equity/facilities/ paths win.
