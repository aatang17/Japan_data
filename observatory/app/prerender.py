"""What a crawler that does not run JavaScript is served.

Every page here is a shell: the header is drawn by nav.js and the numbers
arrive from /api after load. A browser therefore sees a full page and a
crawler that skips JavaScript sees neither the site's links nor a single
figure. Measured before this module existed, cpi.html served 169 words, one
internal link and no data at all, against 633 words and 17 links once
scripts had run.

That gap costs more than search rank. Google renders JavaScript, but on a
second pass that a new domain waits at the back of; the crawlers behind AI
assistants mostly do not render at all, and for a product meant to be cited
those are readers too.

So three things are written into the HTML on the way out:

  * the navigation, as plain links, inside the header shell nav.js fills;
  * the latest reading and a table of the latest values, in a collapsed
    disclosure at the foot of <main> (app/readable.py builds it);
  * a meta description, which no page had;
  * on the landing page, the four coverage counts the script counts up to.

The links go inside the header element whose innerHTML nav.js assigns on
load (nav.js:192), and that script is synchronous and sits immediately
after the element, so a browser never paints the plain list. The figures
used to sit in <noscript>, which a browser never renders — but a number of
the crawlers behind AI assistants strip <noscript> too, so they now sit in
the page proper: a collapsed <details> after the last section, in the same
voice as the page's "Show calculation" disclosures, that no page script
touches. It is visible to a reader who opens it and states exactly what the
rendered tiles state — progressive enhancement, not cloaking. The landing
page's counts are written into the tiles themselves, which the script then
counts up to the same value.

Everything is best-effort. Any failure — an unparseable nav, a dataset
without an overview, a database mid-swap — serves the file untouched rather
than failing the request. A page that renders is worth more than a page that
is perfectly annotated.
