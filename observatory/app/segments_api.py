"""Segment notes and the Company Lens: what a company reports by region and
customer, beside the customs flows its business sits in.

Three surfaces, one rule. Everything a filer states — revenue by region on its
own basis, the customers it names, its reportable segments — is served as
filed. Everything that joins a filer to a customs line is editorial and says
so: customs records carry no company identity, so the mapping in
``app/curation/semi_supply_chain.json`` is platform classification, never a source
classification, and the ratio of filed revenue to customs exports is an
indicator with a formula, never an accounting identity.

Endpoints
---------
  /api/v1/equity/segments/company/{sec_code}   the filed note, both years
  /api/v1/equity/segments/supply-chain          the mapping, names resolved
  /api/v1/equity/segments/customers             who names whom (the edge list)
  /api/v1/equity/segments/lens/{sec_code}       filed + customs, fiscal periods
  /api/v1/equity/segments/lens/{sec_code}.csv   the same as one wide table

The lens reads the macro database for customs values through the same
functions ``/api/v1/trade-semis`` serves from, then sums them into the
company's own fiscal periods with ``app.fiscal`` — the roll-up that refuses
to sum anything that is not a monthly flow, and refuses to sum a period short.

# --- English names for the companies filers name as customers -----------------
#
# A filer writes its customer's name in Japanese, in its own house style:
# 「トヨタ自動車(株)」 and 「トヨタ自動車株式会社」 are the same buyer written twice.
# An English-language product has to show an English name, and the honest way
# to get one is to look the buyer up rather than translate it:
#
#   1. the EDINET company registry, where the buyer is itself a filer — which
#      also yields a securities code, so the buyer's own page can be linked;
#   2. a small curated file, for the government bodies, unlisted subsidiaries
#      and foreign affiliates the registry cannot cover;
#   3. nothing, where no English name exists. A name is never machine-
#      translated and never guessed.
#
# The as-filed name is the identity everywhere and is always shown. The English
# name is a label attached to it, marked with where it came from, and two
# spellings of one buyer stay two rows.
