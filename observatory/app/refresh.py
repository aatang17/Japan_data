"""The daily data refresh, and the watch that notices when it stops.

Why the process ends itself
---------------------------
DuckDB takes one writer, and the API holds a long-lived read-only handle on
the same file, so the ingest cannot run while the server is serving. The
refresh is therefore a restart: start.sh runs the ingests, then serves, and
when the server exits it runs them again. This module is what makes the
server exit, once a day, on the clock.

The alternative — a second Railway service that restarts this one on a cron —
is what observatory/README.md recommended for a month. It was never created,
and in early September 2026 the site quietly served three-day-old yields
because nothing had restarted it since the 1st. An in-repo scheduler cannot
be forgotten, needs no API token, and works identically under Docker and on a
laptop. That is the whole argument for it.

Only when something will restart us
-----------------------------------
Exiting is safe only under a supervisor. start.sh exports
REFRESH_SUPERVISED=1; nothing else does, so a plain `uvicorn app.main:app`
during development is never killed by this code, whatever the clock says.
The health watch below runs everywhere, because it only reports.

Why UTC
-------
The schedule is UTC and the default is 13:00, which is 22:00 in Tokyo — after
the Ministry of Finance posts the day's yield curve and after the 12:00 UTC
EDINET capture job, so an equity refresh reads the same day's archive rather
than yesterday's. Japan has no daylight
saving, so a fixed UTC offset is exactly right all year, and the slim
container image needs no timezone database for it to be.
