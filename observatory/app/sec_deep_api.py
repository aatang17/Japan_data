"""US deep coverage — full filed history for a chosen set of large US companies.

sec_api.py serves every US filer for the quarters the data-set shelf holds.
This module serves the other cut, loaded by equity/sec_companyfacts.py from
the SEC's company-facts files: every number a chosen company has filed since
2009, each tied to the filing that reported it. Four views:

  1. **The universe** (`/deep`): the companies covered, their sector, the
     predecessor registrants carrying their early history, and how deep and
     how fresh each one is.
  2. **What a company files** (`/deep/{company}`): every concept (XBRL tag)
     with a value, its standard label, units, how many periods, and the first
     and last period end — the menu to ask the other two views from.
  3. **Key indicators by period** (`/deep/{company}/indicators`): revenue,
     margins' inputs, cash flows, balance-sheet totals — one row per fiscal
     year (or quarter), each value naming the tag and the filing it came from.
  4. **One concept's history** (`/deep/{company}/series`): every value of one
     tag, one per period, or every filing's version of every period.

Point in time
-------------
A period's number is filed more than once — in its own report, then as a
comparative, sometimes restated. `basis=latest` (default) serves the value
from the most recent filing; `basis=first` the value as first reported;
`basis=all` every version. `as_of=YYYY-MM-DD` first drops every filing filed
after that day, so `as_of` + `latest` is what a reader could have known then.
Choosing among filed values is selection, not calculation: every value is
Official, exactly as filed, and names its accession number.

A company's predecessor registrants (Google Inc. before Alphabet, Exxon
Mobil Corp. before its 2026 holding company) are read together with it; each
row names the CIK that filed it.

Period rules: a duration of 350–380 days is annual, 80–100 days a quarter;
anything else (six- and nine-month year-to-date spans) appears only under
`freq=all`. A fourth quarter is served only where a filer tagged one — it is
never derived as the year less three quarters.
