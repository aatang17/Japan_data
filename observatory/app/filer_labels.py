u"""What kind of institution a 5%-filer is, and which group it belongs to.

Two labels, both DERIVED and both applied at serve time — the extractor stores
only what the filing says (`business_ja`, `occupation_ja`, `holder_type_ja`).
Keeping the reading out of the stored row means changing a rule costs a
redeploy, never a re-extraction, and never rewrites a vintage. Same division of
labour as `facility_labels.py`.

  * **filer_type** — read from the filer's OWN 事業内容 (business description),
    which 88% of holder rows state, plus the filed 法人/個人 flag. It is not a
    guess from the name: a firm is called an asset manager here because it
    filed 投資運用業, and a holder whose filing states nothing is `not_stated`
    and renders as a gap.

  * **group** — the family a filing entity belongs to. This one CANNOT come
    from a filing: BlackRock files under sixteen EDINET codes, Fidelity under
    thirteen, Nomura under ten, and no document names the parent. So it is a
    hand-curated map, kept deliberately small, and every entry carries the name
    exactly as it appears in the filings so it can be checked. A code that is
    not in the map is its own group — never guessed from a shared word, because
    Sumitomo Corporation and Sumitomo Mitsui Banking are not one company and
    "Capital" is in the name of forty-eight unrelated firms.
