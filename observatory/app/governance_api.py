"""Equity product API — boards and pay (役員の状況・役員の報酬等).

Product surface #3, served from the same DuckDB file and the same reader as the
cross-shareholding API next door (equity_api.py): one connection, one writer
discipline, one set of English company names. Registered BEFORE the core router
for the same reason equity_api is — its literal /equity/ paths must beat the
core's /{dataset}/ catch-alls.

Two disclosures are carried in the DATA, not in prose, and every response that
touches the numbers repeats them (see METHODOLOGY-BOARDS-AND-PAY.md §2):

  1. Named individual pay is 連結報酬等 — CONSOLIDATED, including pay from group
     companies. It is a different basis from the officer-category table, so the
     two must never be netted, subtracted or divided into one another. Rows say
     so (`pay_basis`), and `named_exceeds_category` marks the filings where the
     arithmetic itself proves the bases differ.
  2. Pay components need not sum to the filed category total, because filers
     disagree on whether 非金銭報酬等 is additive or an "of which" memo and print
     components rounded to ¥mn. `total_yen` is the published number;
     `components_reconcile` says whether that filing's own components add up.

Cross-sections run against ONE filing per company (its latest, or the one
covering ?year=), never one row per filing: the archive holds five fiscal years
and a company would otherwise appear five times.
