"""Accounts: an email sign-in link, a session, and nothing else.

What an account is for
----------------------
It holds the companies a reader follows. Every dataset on this platform stays
readable without one, so nothing here gates data — a failure in this module
costs a reader their list, never the numbers.

What is deliberately absent
---------------------------
**Passwords.** Signing in and signing up are one action: the reader gives an
address, we email a single-use link, and clicking it both proves the address
and creates the session. There is no hash to leak, no reset flow to abuse, and
no second form for the reader to work out.

Where the data lives
--------------------
A **SQLite file of its own** on the `data/` volume, never the DuckDB datasets.
Ingest guardrail 5 says the serving process must not write the dataset files;
this is a different engine writing a different file, so both remain true, and a
dataset rebuild cannot touch a reader's account. WAL mode, because the API
process handles requests concurrently.

The kill switch
---------------
`ACCOUNTS_ENABLED` must be truthy or `main.py` does not mount this router at
all. Every account endpoint then 404s, and the sign-in page reads that as "not
switched on" and says so rather than showing a form that cannot work.

Delivery
--------
Resend's HTTP API over stdlib urllib — no new dependency. Without
`RESEND_API_KEY` the module is in **development delivery**: the link is written
to the server log instead of sent, so the whole flow is testable before any
mail leaves the building. `ACCOUNTS_DEV_LINKS` additionally returns the link in
the response, which is for a laptop and must never be set in production.

Tokens
------
32 bytes from `secrets`, single use, thirty minutes. Only the SHA-256 of a
token is stored, so the database cannot be replayed into a session. A session
cookie is the same shape: a random token, stored as a hash, HttpOnly and
SameSite=Lax, thirty days, refreshed as it is used.
