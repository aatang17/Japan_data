"""US executive pay — the proxy's pay-versus-performance table, S&P 500 wide.

equity/sec_proxy_pay.py reads every S&P 500 member's proxy statements
(DEF 14A, 2023 on) into data/sec.duckdb. This module serves them:

  1. **The index** (`/api/v1/us/pay`): one row per member for its latest
     fiscal year — the CEO's reported pay and "compensation actually paid",
     the other named executives' averages, and shareholder return.
  2. **One company** (`/api/v1/us/pay/{ticker}`): every fiscal year its
     proxies cover, each CEO separately where a year had more than one, and
     every proxy read with its status.

What the figures are
--------------------
All exactly as filed in the SEC's `ecd` taxonomy (Item 402(v)); nothing is
recomputed. "Total pay" is the Summary Compensation Table total. "Actually
paid" is the SEC-defined figure the company computes by marking equity awards
to market, so it can be far above total pay or below zero. Shareholder return
is the value at the fiscal year end of $100 invested at the start of the
table's first year. Where a year had two CEOs the proxy tags each by name;
their figures are listed separately and never summed.

Point in time
-------------
Each proxy repeats up to five years. `basis=latest` (default) takes each
value from the most recent proxy that carries it; `basis=first` from the
first; `as_of=YYYY-MM-DD` drops proxies filed after that day first.
