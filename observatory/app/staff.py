"""Staff accounts: one login per person for the admin console.

Why this exists
---------------
The console began as one shared password. That stopped being enough when a
second person started writing for the site: a shared password cannot say who
published an article, cannot take one person's access away without changing
everyone's, and — because its sessions are signed with a per-boot secret —
signs everybody out on every deploy, which for a writer mid-draft means lost
work. Each person now has an email, a password and a set of permissions.

Permissions
-----------
``team``            add people, change their permissions, issue setup links
``operations``      ingest health, release history, traffic, the audit log
``classification``  party profiles and the classification queue
``writing``         the research desk: write, edit and publish articles

How a person gets in
--------------------
Somebody with ``team`` adds them and is shown a **setup link** — valid for
72 hours, used once. They send it themselves (chat, email, anything); the new
person opens it and chooses their own password. Nothing here sends mail, so
no mail provider is needed, and no password ever passes through a third
party. A forgotten password is the same move: a fresh setup link.

The shared password
-------------------
``ADMIN_PASSWORD`` keeps working, signed in as "Shared password" with every
permission. That is how the first real account gets created on a deployment
that has none, and it is the way back in if every owner is locked out. Once
the people who need access have their own accounts, remove the variable and
the shared login is gone. The Team page says whether it is still on.

Where it lives
--------------
A SQLite file of its own under ``data/admin/`` on the volume — never the
DuckDB datasets (ingest guardrail 5). Passwords are PBKDF2-SHA256 with a
per-password salt at 600,000 iterations, the stdlib function, so nothing new
is installed. Sessions and setup tokens are random and only their SHA-256 is
stored, so a copy of the file cannot be replayed into a login.
