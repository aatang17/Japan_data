The ceiling travels on a contextvar (app/asof.py), which means nothing about a
query that forgets to apply it fails loudly — it just quietly returns today's
filing. This file is the guarantee instead of that: it runs every company view
under a ceiling and fails if any filing in the response was filed after it.
