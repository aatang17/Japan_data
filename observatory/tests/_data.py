"""Which databases this machine has, and the only reasons a test may skip
because it hasn't got them.

CI has no data at all: no volume, no DuckDB file, no source fetch. Eighty-odd
of these tests need numbers to mean anything, so they have to say so — and a
skip is the quietest way there is to delete a test. That is why the reason
strings live here rather than being typed at each decorator:

  * ``ci/suite.py --mode ci`` fails the run on a skip whose reason is not in
    ``REASONS``. Nothing can be switched off by inventing a new excuse.
  * ``ci/suite.py --mode full`` fails the run on a skip whose reason *is* in
    ``REASONS``. On the machine that holds the data, every one of them must
    actually execute.

So a test guarded by one of these flags is not a test we have given up on. It
is a test that runs before every push instead of on every commit.
